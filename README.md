## Idea:

I saw someone make a kanban board project and thought I want my own board :>

## Technologies:

I think about using hygraph as a storage and React DnD as a drag and drop solution.

## Configuaration

Project was configured using [this](https://dev.to/alexeagleson/how-to-build-scalable-architecture-for-your-nextjs-project-2pb7#project-setup) tutorial from Alex Eagleson
